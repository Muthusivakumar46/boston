# JavaScript Module Project

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript ES6 modules to organize code. The HTML file includes a basic setup with a styled `div` container where content can be dynamically injected via JavaScript.

## Features

- Uses ES6 module syntax with an external JavaScript file (`index.js`).
- Simple HTML structure with a styled `div` container for displaying content.
- Modular code organization to separate JavaScript logic from HTML.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/js-module-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd js-module-project
    ```
3. Create an `index.js` file in the project directory to write your JavaScript code. The file will be loaded as a module.

4. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the content generated by your JavaScript module.

## Usage

- Modify the `index.js` file to add JavaScript code that manipulates or adds content to the `#app` div container.
- Use this setup as a foundation for projects that utilize JavaScript ES6 modules for better code organization.
